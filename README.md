# burger

## Vanderbilt FullStack Coding Bootcamp: 
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I followed the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.

Here is where to find my working app: https://shielded-harbor-10776.herokuapp.com/
